      <h2>Program Analysis and Insights</h2>
      <p><br>
        The PE.T program addresses a critical gap in academic support for technical
         disciplines by fostering peer-to-peer mentorship. This approach not only aids students academically but
          also builds community and leadership skills among tutors.
      </br></p>
      <p><br>
        The websiteâ€™s design and functionality are carefully aligned with these goals by emphasizing 
        ease of access, clear navigation,and resource availability, which are essential for student engagement
         and success.
      <br></p>
      <p><br>
        Furthermore, the inclusion of a contact form promotes direct communication, encouraging timely assistance
        and building trust between students and tutors. This comprehensive approach is expected to significantly enhance
         both learning outcomes and tutor development.
